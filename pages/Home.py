## BPhO Computational Challenge 2024 Submission - Projectiles

#### Kenneth Lew and Timothy Ka

The British Physics Olympiad (BPhO) Computational Challenge is a competition designed to test students' problem-solving abilities using computational methods. This year's computational challenge consists of a series of 9 progressively difficult tasks focused on the dynamics of projectiles.

Our submission is a website written completely using [**Streamlit**](https://streamlit.io/), an open-source app framework which allows us to easily write interactive web apps quickly and easily using only Python. The embedded interactive charts are generated using [**Plotly**](https://plotly.com/python/), a powerful open-source data visualization library.
